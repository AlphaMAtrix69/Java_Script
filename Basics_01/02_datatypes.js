//There is whole difference b/w JS of earlier version & current version,
//earlier there were no classes modules & arrow functions & so much code of JS is coded with earlier format.
// So to establish same standard for JS coding we use "use strict" 
"use strict" //Treat all JS code  as newer version

///working with Datatype in JS is easy
let name = "name" //declared in " " then string
let age = 17 //int
let isUser = true //boolean type

//Types of datatype
//numbers 
//bigint
//string
//boolean
//null - It is value(standalone) as well as datatype, it means empty variable is declared but assigned value is null
//Undefined - Value is not defined but variable is declared
//Symbol - unique

//object 

console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined - it is a different type
console.log(typeof null); //object
