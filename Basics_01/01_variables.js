// In JS variable declaration happen in 3 ways
// 1) Using const keyword, can't change the assigned value
// 2) Using let & var keyword, can change assigned value
// 3) by just declaring & initializing variable name & value, change assigned value


// but but so let & var are used multiple times for same thing here comes catch 
// var has issue in block scope & functional scope.
